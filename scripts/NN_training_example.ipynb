    "### Training the Neural Network\n",
    "\n",
    "The easiest way to train the network requires providing a pandas dataframe where the index are the reaction keys and the columns the different training examples (see above). You can also provide a numpy array and the reaction keys as a separate list. During training the function will automatically generate the training dataset. You can change the number of times each training model is used (nuplo). You can also give a range of deletion percentages (min_for to max_for) which will be removed in equal sized steps based on the number of replicates. There is also optional parameter that can be used to weigh the deletion of certain reactions (del_p). It is also possible to add false reactions (using min_con and max_con), but we do not currently use it and it will not work with the masking of input reactions (as the mask does not differentiate between contamination and real reactions).\n",
    "\n",
    "You can provide labels (the full set of reactions) for the network to try and predict, if no labels are provided the network will asume that your input (the data without deletions) should be what the network tries to predict. \n",
    "\n",
    "You can rely on the default parameters to define the network which we optimised for our usecase, but for optimal perfomance on different datasets, you might want to change the hyperparameters (dropout, batch size), the architecture (nnodes, nlayers) or bias of predicted classes. You can also disable the masking of input positions during loss calculation. Finally you can determine a validation split which will set apart a part of your input data during training and calculate scores after to validate your network.\n",
    "\n",
    "The function will return a class containing a Tensorflow object (the network), the list of reactions which respond to the output nodes (reaction keys) and the modeltype (ModelSEED, BiGG etc.). If save=True you can save these as a .h5 file. \n",
